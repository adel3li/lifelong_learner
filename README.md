  - **Why Are We Talking about This**

    - What employers want (e.g., reliability) and how to be so good they can't live without you
    - The importance of building a "personal brand" intentionally (being in the driver’s seat of your career)
    - The importance of continual education and unlearning what holds us back (preconditioning can hinder our progress)
    - Three dimensions to track: IQ (intelligence quotient), EQ (emotional quotient), and AQ (adaptability quotient); soft skills are actually the hard part
    - Taking inventory of skills (see assigned exercise) and the importance of introspection

  - **The Power of Pause**
    - <b>*“Between the stimulus and response, there is a space. And in that space lies our freedom and power to choose our responses. In our response lies our growth and our freedom” — Viktor Frankl*</b>
    - *Frankl founded a school of psychology, logotherapy, which promotes the ability to endure through searching for meaning. The power of pause is in leveraging it to search, for meaning, for where the other person is coming from, for what we want to achieve — to frame a response that is thoughtful and meaningful. It’s a superpower that can be trained. The first step is to observe that the situation requires a pause. Meditation and other mindfulness practices help. Perhaps the first step is to acknowledge that, just like any other skill, learning is a journey and practice is lifelong. Here’s an example of Steve Jobs pausing for almost 20 seconds, on stage, to answer a loaded question thoughtfully.*
