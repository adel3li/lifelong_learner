  - **Why Are We Talking about This**
    - Your job is not the current job; it's building repeat successes and growth over time (for yourself and others around you)
    - What employers want (e.g., reliability) and how to be so good they can't live without you
    - The importance of building a "personal brand" intentionally (being in the driver’s seat of your career)
    - The importance of continual education and unlearning what holds us back (preconditioning can hinder our progress)
    - Three dimensions to track: IQ (intelligence quotient), EQ (emotional quotient), and AQ (adaptability quotient); soft skills are actually the hard part
    - Taking inventory of skills (see assigned exercise) and the importance of introspection
