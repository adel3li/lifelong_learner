  <summary><strong>Why Are We Talking about This</strong></summary>

  - Your job is not the current job; it's building repeat successes and growth over time (for yourself and others around you)
  - What employers want (e.g., reliability) and how to be so good they can't live without you
  - The importance of building a "personal brand" intentionally (being in the driver’s seat of your career)
  - The importance of continual education and unlearning what holds us back (preconditioning can hinder our progress)
  - Three dimensions to track: IQ (intelligence quotient), EQ (emotional quotient), and AQ (adaptability quotient); soft skills are actually the hard part
  - Taking inventory of skills (see assigned exercise) and the importance of introspection

    <summary><strong>The Power of Pause</strong></summary>

  - <b>*“Between the stimulus and response, there is a space. And in that space lies our freedom and power to choose our responses. In our response lies our growth and our freedom” — Viktor Frankl*</b>
  - *Frankl founded a school of psychology, logotherapy, which promotes the ability to endure through searching for meaning. The power of pause is in leveraging it to search, for meaning, for where the other person is coming from, for what we want to achieve — to frame a response that is thoughtful and meaningful. It’s a superpower that can be trained. The first step is to observe that the situation requires a pause. Meditation and other mindfulness practices help. Perhaps the first step is to acknowledge that, just like any other skill, learning is a journey and practice is lifelong. Here’s an example of Steve Jobs pausing for almost 20 seconds, on stage, to answer a loaded question thoughtfully.*

    <summary><strong>Entrainment and the Dance of Conversation</strong></summary>

  - Watch the first six minutes of the attached video (or finish the rest, which is also good).

  - Entrainment in speech is a form of isopraxism (mirroring) when participants in a conversation match or find a middle ground for word choices, speech rate, tone, volume, etc. Here's an excerpt from an attached study:

  "A phenomenon that has been repeatedly documented in human-human conversations is the tendency of interlocutors to become more similar to each other in the way they speak. This behavior, known in the literature as entrainment, accommodation or adaptation, has been shown to occur along several dimensions during human-human interaction, including: pronunciation (Pardo, 2006); choice of referring expressions (Brennan and Clark, 1996); syntactic structure (Reitter et al., 2011); turn-taking cues (Levitan et al., 2015b); choice of intonational contour (Gravano et al., 2015); and acoustic-prosodic behavior (Ward, Litman, 2007, Levitan, Hirschberg, 2011)... Entrainment has been associated with multiple social aspects in human-human conversations (Beňuš, 2014), such as degree of success in completing tasks (Nenkova, Gravano, Hirschberg, 2008, Reitter, Moore, 2014), perception of competence and social attractiveness (Street Jr, 1984, Levitan, Gravano, Hirschberg, 2011, Beňuš, Gravano, Levitan, Levitan, Willson, Hirschberg, 2014, Michalsky, Schoormann, 2017, Schweitzer, Lewandowski, 2014), and degree of speaker engagement (De Looze, Scherer, Vaughan, Campbell, 2014, Gravano, Beňuš, Levitan, Hirschberg, 2015)."
